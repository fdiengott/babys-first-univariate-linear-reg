# Baby's first univariate linear regression

This is my first attempt at building an ML model! I have been going through the BlueDot AI Safety fundamentals technical course and felt it was important to understand the fundamentals of ML to the degree that I could build simple models. So in addition to the blue dot course, I am also going through the [machine learning introduction](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) course taught by Andrew Ng on coursera.

This is a linear regression model based on one variable. I will soon follow up with a simple multi-variate model.
